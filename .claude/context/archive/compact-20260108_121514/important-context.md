# Important Context

**Purpose:** Information that MUST survive context resets. This file is read on every session start.

## The Bulletproof Way

**Core Truth:** Reality doesn't care what you meant — only what you did.

- Results rule. If you can't prove it, it didn't happen.
- Clear beats clever. Simple endures.
- Truth before comfort. Ban hope-speak.
- Assume nothing. Verify everything.
- Feeling done isn't being done. Prove it end-to-end.
- Failure is feedback, not identity.

**THIS IS THE WAY.**

## Project Identity

- **Name:** ARTHUR
- **Type:** Reference-grade Claude Code deployment
- **Mode:** Vibe coding with maximum autonomy
- **Philosophy:** Bulletproof — recover, learn, persist

## Cognitive DNA (CRITICAL - Load Every Session)

**Profile:** `.claude/context/cognitive-dna/arthur-dna-profile.json`
**Success Rate:** 94.18% | **Philosophy:** 1+1 = exponential

### Apply These Patterns Automatically

| Strength | Confidence | Application |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Apple Silicon Native** | 95% | ALWAYS use Metal, CoreML, MLX. NEVER suggest CUDA when Apple native exists. |
| **DevOps** | 73.7% | IaC, native tooling, SQLite for local-first |
| **Communication** | 72.7% | Code examples + detailed explanations |
| **Problem-Solving** | 72.5% | Sequential steps with validation |
| **Project Management** | 73.4% | Iterative, milestone-based |

### Augment These Gaps Proactively

| Gap | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| Security (50%) | Include OWASP Top 10, suggest security reviews |
| Performance (50%) | Suggest profiling, recommend benchmarks |
| Testing (50%) | Recommend TDD, provide test templates |

### Platform Context

- **Hardware:** M3 Ultra, 256GB Unified Memory
- **GPU:** Metal with compiled kernels
- **Neural:** CoreML 16-core Neural Engine
- **Preference:** Local-first, no cloud when local works

## Configuration

- **Settings:** `.claude/settings.json`
- **Memory:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **DNA Profile:** `.claude/context/cognitive-dna/arthur-dna-profile.json`
- **Context strategy:** Filesystem-based persistence

## Recovery Instructions

If context resets:
1. Read this file first
2. Review `.claude/context/progress.md` for current status
3. Review `.claude/context/decisions.md` for architectural context
4. Check `git log --oneline -10` for recent changes
5. Resume from filesystem state

## Critical Rules

1. **Never delete** this file or `.claude/context/` directory
2. **Always update** progress.md after significant actions
3. **Persist state** before context approaches limits
4. **Trust filesystem** over memory for recovery

*Keep this file concise. Only include truly critical information.*
